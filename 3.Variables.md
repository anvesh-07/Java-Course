# Variables in Java: The Building Blocks of Data ðŸ§±

This document explains what variables are in Java, how they store data, and the different types available.

## A Quick Recap: Working of Java Code

Before diving into variables, let's remember how Java works. You write code in a `.java` file, the **compiler** (`javac`) turns it into universal **bytecode** (`.class` file), and the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** runs that bytecode.

When the JVM runs your code, it needs a place to store the data your program is working with, like numbers, text, or true/false values. It reserves a portion of your computer's memory (RAM) for this purpose. This is where variables come in.

## How is Data Stored in Memory?

Think of your computer's memory as a giant wall of mailboxes. Each mailbox has a unique address. When you create a variable, you're essentially asking the JVM to:

1.  Find an empty mailbox (a small piece of memory).
2.  Put a label on it (the **variable name**).
3.  Place a value inside it (the **data**).

When you need to use that data later, you just refer to it by its label (the variable name), and the JVM knows exactly where to find it.

## What are Variables?

A **variable** is a container that holds a value. It's a named piece of memory that you can use to store and manipulate data in your program. Every variable in Java has a **type**, which determines what kind of data it can hold (e.g., a whole number, a decimal number, a single character).

## Syntax of Declaring a Variable

To create (or "declare") a variable, you must specify its type and give it a name. You can also give it an initial value at the same time.

The syntax is: `type variableName = value;`

- **`type`**: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int` for integers).
- **`variableName`**: The name you give to the variable (e.g., `userAge`).
- **`=`**: The assignment operator, used to give the variable a value.
- **`value`**: The data you want to store in the variable (e.g., `25`).
- **`;`**: The semicolon marks the end of the statement.

**Example:**

```java
// Declaring an integer variable named 'score' and initializing it with the value 100.
int score = 100;

// Declaring a character variable named 'grade'.
char grade;
// Assigning a value to it later.
grade = 'A';
```

## Primitive Data Types: Size and Range

Java has eight fundamental ("primitive") data types. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of their size and the range of values they can hold.

| Type      | Size (in Bits) | Size (in Bytes) | Range of Values                                                                |
| :-------- | :------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `byte`    | 8 bits         | 1 Byte          | -128 to 127                                                                    |
| `short`   | 16 bits        | 2 Bytes         | -32,768 to 32,767                                                              |
| `int`     | 32 bits        | 4 Bytes         | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                                                |
| `long`    | 64 bits        | 8 Bytes         | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807                        |
| `float`   | 32 bits        | 4 Bytes         | Stores decimal numbers. Sufficient for 6 to 7 decimal digits.                  |
| `double`  | 64 bits        | 8 Bytes         | Stores decimal numbers. Sufficient for about 15 decimal digits (more precise). |
| `char`    | 16 bits        | 2 Bytes         | A single Unicode character (e.g., 'a', '$', '5').                              |
| `boolean` | \~1 bit        | \~1 Byte\*      | `true` or `false`                                                              |

\* **Note on `boolean` size**: While a boolean represents only one bit of information (`true`/`false`), the JVM typically allocates a full byte of memory for it for practical reasons related to memory addressing.
