# Java Loops: Repeating Actions with Ease ðŸ”„

In programming, you often need to repeat a task multiple times. For example, you might want to print the numbers from 1 to 100, process every item in a shopping cart, or read every line in a file. Instead of writing the same code over and over again, you use **loops**.

Loops are fundamental structures in Java that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met. This guide covers the three main types of loops in Java.

## 1\. The `for` Loop: The Counter

The **`for` loop** is your go-to loop when you know exactly **how many times** you want to repeat an action. It's like telling someone to take exactly 5 steps forward. You define a starting point, an ending condition, and how to get from the start to the end (the increment).

### When to Use It

- When you have a fixed number of iterations.
- When you need to iterate over a range of numbers.
- When processing every element of an array or list by its index.

### Syntax

```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
```

- **`initialization`**: A counter variable is declared and initialized (e.g., `int i = 0`). This runs only once at the very beginning.
- **`condition`**: The loop continues as long as this condition is `true` (e.g., `i < 5`). It's checked _before_ each iteration.
- **`update`**: How the counter changes after each iteration (e.g., `i++`).

### Code Example

This loop prints numbers from 1 to 5.

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Current count is: " + i);
}
```

**Output:**

```
Current count is: 1
Current count is: 2
Current count is: 3
Current count is: 4
Current count is: 5
```

### The Enhanced `for` Loop (or "for-each")

This is a simpler, more readable version of the `for` loop specifically for iterating over all elements of an **array** or **collection**. You don't need to manage a counter variable (`i`).

**Analogy:** Instead of counting items in a grocery bag one by one, you just say, "For each item in this bag, check it off my list."

```java
String[] fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Orange"};

for (String fruit : fruits) {
    System.out.println("I have a " + fruit);
}
```

## 2\. The `while` Loop: The Gatekeeper

The **`while` loop** repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains `true`. Unlike the `for` loop, you use it when you **don't know** the exact number of iterations beforehand.

**Analogy:** "While the traffic light is red, keep waiting." You don't know how long it will be red, but you keep checking the condition (the light's color) _before_ deciding whether to wait again or go.

### When to Use It

- When the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.
- When reading from a file until you reach the end.
- When waiting for user input.

### Syntax

```java
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute
    // IMPORTANT: The condition must eventually become false inside the loop!
}
```

### Code Example

This loop simulates a countdown until a rocket launches.

```java
int countdown = 5;

while (countdown > 0) {
    System.out.println(countdown + "...");
    countdown--; // This line is crucial to prevent an infinite loop!
}

System.out.println("Liftoff!");
```

**Output:**

```
5...
4...
3...
2...
1...
Liftoff!
```

---

## 3\. The `do-while` Loop: The Eager Gatekeeper

The **`do-while` loop** is very similar to the `while` loop, with one critical difference: the code block is executed **at least once** _before_ the condition is checked.

**Analogy:** You enter a movie theater and show your ticket. The action (entering) happens first, and the condition (checking the ticket) happens after. You are guaranteed to perform the action at least one time.

### When to Use It

- When you need to execute a block of code at least once, regardless of the condition.
- Often used for menus where you want to display the options first and then ask the user for input.

### Syntax

```java
do {
    // Code to execute (this block ALWAYS runs at least once)
} while (condition);
```

### Code Example

This loop asks for a password at least once.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
String password;

do {
    System.out.print("Enter the password: ");
    password = scanner.nextLine();
} while (!password.equals("secret")); // Keep asking until the correct password is given

System.out.println("Access Granted!");
```

## Loop Control Statements

You can control the flow of a loop from within its body.

- **`break`**: Immediately terminates the loop and continues execution at the statement after the loop.

  ```java
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
      if (i == 5) {
          System.out.println("Found 5, breaking the loop!");
          break; // Exit the loop now
      }
      System.out.println(i); // This will only print 1, 2, 3, 4
  }
  ```

- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next one.

  ```java

  for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
      if (i == 3) {
          System.out.println("Skipping number 3...");
          continue; // Skip the rest of this iteration
      }
      System.out.println("Processing number " + i);
  }
  ```
