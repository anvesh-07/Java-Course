# Introduction to Programming & Java

## 1. Introduction to Programming

### What is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions (called a **program**) that a computer can understand and execute to perform a specific task.

Think of programming like giving step-by-step instructions to a friend to make tea:

1. Boil water.
2. Add tea leaves.
3. Pour into a cup.
4. Add sugar and milk.
5. Stir and serve.

In the same way, we write instructions for a computer to follow.

### How Programs Run

- A program is written in a **programming language** (e.g., Java, Python, C++).
- These instructions are **translated** into machine code (binary 0s and 1s) that the computer's processor can understand.

### Compilers vs. Interpreters

- **Compiler**: Translates the entire program into machine code before running it.

  - Example: Java, C++
  - **Analogy**: Translating an entire book before reading it.

- **Interpreter**: Translates and runs the program line-by-line.

  - Example: Python, JavaScript
  - **Analogy**: Translating a book sentence-by-sentence while reading.

**Example**:

```java
// Java (compiled)
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

```python
# Python (interpreted)
print("Hello, World!")
```

## 2. Introduction to Java

### Brief History

- **Created by**: James Gosling and team at Sun Microsystems (1991).
- **First release**: 1995.
- **Owned by**: Oracle Corporation (since 2010).

### Features of Java

- **Platform Independent** (Write Once, Run Anywhere)
- **Object-Oriented**
- **Robust & Secure**
- **Rich API**
- **Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)**

### Advantages

- Portable and cross-platform
- Strong community support
- Huge ecosystem of libraries & frameworks

### Real-World Uses

- Web applications (Spring, Jakarta EE)
- Mobile apps (Android)
- Enterprise software
- Game development (Minecraft)
- Cloud-based solutions

## 3. Java Installation Guide

### Step 1: Download Java

You can install Java from either:

- [**Oracle JDK Downloads**](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [**OpenJDK Downloads**](https://jdk.java.net/) (Open-source)

### Step 2: Install Java

#### **Windows**

1. Download the installer from the above link.
2. Run the `.exe` file and follow the setup wizard.
3. After installation, set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:

   - Press `Windows + R` → type `sysdm.cpl` → press Enter.
   - Go to **Advanced** → **Environment Variables**.
   - Add a new variable:

     - Name: `JAVA_HOME`
     - Value: Path to your Java installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21`).

   - Add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the **Path** variable.

#### **macOS**

1. Install using **Homebrew**:

   ```bash
   brew install openjdk@21
   ```

2. Add Java to your shell profile (`.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`):

   ```bash
   export JAVA_HOME="$(brew --prefix openjdk@21)"
   export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
   ```

#### **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**

1. Install OpenJDK:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
   ```

2. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

3. Set `JAVA_HOME` in `.bashrc`:

   ```bash
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Run:

```bash
java -version
```

Expected output:

```
java version "21" 2023-09-19 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment ...
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM ...
```

## 4. Java Interview Questions & Answers (Beginner Level)

### Q1. What is Java?

**Answer:** Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is platform-independent and designed to be secure, portable, and robust.

### Q2. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?

**Answer:**

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Executes Java bytecode.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: JVM + libraries needed to run Java applications.
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: JRE + development tools (compiler, debugger, etc.).

### Q3. Why is Java called "platform independent"?

**Answer:** Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any system with a JVM, regardless of the underlying operating system.

### Q4. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter in Java?

**Answer:** Java uses both:

- **Compiler (javac)** converts Java source code into bytecode.
- **Interpreter (JVM)** executes the bytecode line by line.

### Q5. What are some key features of Java?

**Answer:**

- Object-oriented
- Platform-independent
- Secure
- Robust
- Automatic memory management

### Q6. What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Java?

**Answer:**

- `==` compares object references (memory addresses).
- `.equals()` compares the content of objects (if overridden).

### Q7. What is a Class and an Object?

**Answer:**

- **Class**: Blueprint for creating objects.
- **Object**: Instance of a class containing data and methods.

### Q8. What is the main() method in Java?

**Answer:** It is the entry point of a Java program:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // program starts here
}
```

### Q9. What is Garbage Collection in Java?

**Answer:** The process of automatically freeing memory by removing unused objects.

### Q10. What is the difference between `final`, `finally`, and `finalize()`?

**Answer:**

- **final**: Keyword used for constants, preventing method overriding or inheritance.
- **finally**: Block in try-catch used for cleanup code.
- **finalize()**: Method called by garbage collector before destroying an object.
