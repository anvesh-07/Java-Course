# An Introduction to Data Types in Java 🗂️

This guide explains the different types of data that can be stored and manipulated in a Java program.

## What is a Data Type?

A **data type** is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold.  
It tells the compiler:

- How much memory to allocate for the variable.
- What kind of data it can store (e.g., a whole number, a decimal, a character).

Think of data types like different kinds of containers:

- 🥤 **Cup** → for water (decimal number)
- 📦 **Small box** → for a ring (single character)
- 📚 **Large crate** → for books (text)

In Java, data types are **statically typed**, meaning every variable must have its type declared before you can use it.  
This helps prevent errors, like trying to store a word in a number variable.

## Categories of Data Types in Java

Java's data types fall into two main categories:

1. **Primitive Types** – Eight fundamental building blocks of data.
2. **Reference (Non-Primitive) Types** – Objects created from classes.

## 1. Primitive Data Types

Primitive types store **actual values** directly in memory.  
There are **eight primitive types**:

### **Integer Types** (whole numbers)

| Type    | Size    | Example                                | Usage                                 |
| ------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `byte`  | 1 byte  | `byte age = 30;`                       | Very small numbers (saves memory).    |
| `short` | 2 bytes | `short year = 2024;`                   | Small-to-medium numbers.              |
| `int`   | 4 bytes | `int salary = 50000;`                  | Most common choice for whole numbers. |
| `long`  | 8 bytes | `long nationalDebt = 23000000000000L;` | Very large whole numbers.             |

### **Floating-Point Types** (numbers with decimals)

| Type     | Size    | Example                     | Usage                           |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `float`  | 4 bytes | `float price = 19.99f;`     | 6-7 decimal precision.          |
| `double` | 8 bytes | `double pi = 3.1415926535;` | 15 decimal precision (default). |

### **Other Primitives**

| Type      | Size    | Example                      | Usage                            |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `char`    | 2 bytes | `char grade = 'A';`          | Single character.                |
| `boolean` | 1 bit   | `boolean isLoggedIn = true;` | Logical values (`true`/`false`). |

## 2. Reference (Non-Primitive) Types

Reference types store **memory addresses** that point to objects, not the actual value.

> Example:  
> A primitive variable is like a box holding a $20 bill.  
> A reference variable is like a note with the address of a safe containing the $20.

### Examples of Reference Types:

- `String` (sequence of characters)
- Arrays
- Objects from your own classes (`Car`, `Student`)
- Java's built-in library objects (`Scanner`, `ArrayList`)

```java
// 'greeting' is a reference variable.
// It stores the memory address of the "Hello, World!" object.
String greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

**Key Difference:**  
A primitive `int` stores the value `10` directly, but a `String` stores an **address** pointing to where `"Hello"` is stored.

## Type Conversion (Type Casting)

Sometimes you need to convert a value from one type to another.

Two main types:

### 1. **Widening Conversion** (Automatic)

Automatically converts smaller types to larger types — **no data loss**.

**Order:** `byte → short → int → long → float → double`

```java
int myInt = 9;
double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic: int → double

System.out.println(myInt);    // 9
System.out.println(myDouble); // 9.0
```

---

### 2. **Narrowing Conversion** (Manual)

Manually converts larger types to smaller types — **possible data loss**.

```java
double myDouble = 9.78d;
int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual: double → int (truncates decimal)

System.out.println(myDouble); // 9.78
System.out.println(myInt);    // 9
```
