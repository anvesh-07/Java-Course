# Java Conditionals: Making Decisions in Your Code ðŸ§ 

In programming, you often need your application to make decisions and perform different actions based on different situations. For example, you might show a "Login Successful" message if a user enters the correct password, and an "Error" message if they don't.

This is where **conditional statements** come in. They allow your code to follow different paths based on whether a condition is `true` or `false`.

## The `if` Statement: The Basic Check

The **`if`** statement is the simplest decision-making tool. It's like asking a question. If the answer is "yes" (the condition is **`true`**), a specific block of code runs. If the answer is "no," the code block is simply skipped.

**Analogy:** "If it's sunny outside, I will wear sunglasses." You only perform the action if the condition is met.

### Syntax

```java
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```

### Code Example

```java
int score = 85;

// We only print a message if the score is greater than 80.
if (score > 80) {
  System.out.println("Congratulations! You passed with a high score!");
}
```

## The `if-else` Statement: The Two-Way Choice

The **`if-else`** statement provides an alternative path for when the `if` condition is **`false`**. It creates a clear "this or that" choice.

**Analogy:** "If it is raining, I will take an umbrella; otherwise (else), I will wear a hat." You are guaranteed to do one of the two actions.

### Syntax

```java
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```

### Code Example

```java
int age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
  System.out.println("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
  System.out.println("Sorry, you are not yet eligible to vote.");
}
```

---

## The `else if` Statement: The Multi-Path Choice

What if you have more than two possible paths? You can use the **`else if`** statement to check multiple conditions in a sequence. Java checks each condition one by one until it finds one that is `true`. As soon as it finds a true condition, it runs that code block and skips all the rest.

**Analogy:** This is like sorting mail into different bins. "If it's a bill, put it in the 'To Pay' bin; else if it's a letter from a friend, put it in the 'To Read' bin; else (for everything else), put it in the 'Junk' bin."

### Syntax

```java
if (condition_1) {
  // Code for Path A
} else if (condition_2) {
  // Code for Path B
} else if (condition_3) {
  // Code for Path C
} else {
  // Code to run if none of the above conditions are true
}
```

### Code Example

Let's assign a letter grade based on a score.

```java
int score = 78;
char grade;

if (score >= 90) {
  grade = 'A';
} else if (score >= 80) {
  grade = 'B';
} else if (score >= 70) {
  grade = 'C'; // This condition is true, so grade becomes 'C'.
} else if (score >= 60) {
  grade = 'D'; // This and the 'else' block below are skipped.
} else {
  grade = 'F';
}

System.out.println("Your grade is: " + grade); // Outputs: Your grade is: C
```

## Key Takeaways

- Use a simple **`if`** for a single, optional action.
- Use **`if-else`** for a two-way choice where one of two actions must be taken.
- Use **`if-else if-else`** for a multi-path choice where you need to check several conditions in order.
